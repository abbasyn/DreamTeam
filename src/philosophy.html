                  these lessons are repeatedly the most impactful, based on

            Agile Is Dead! Long Live Agile? ü§∑
          </h3>
          <p>
            In a lot of ways Agile has really jumped the shark. Don‚Äôt take our
            word for it though,ask one of its creators."The Agile Manifesto core
            value of ‚ÄúIndividuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools‚Äù ran
            right into the SaaS-plosion we‚Äôre living in today. The rise of task
            management masquerading as project management really did a number on
            ‚ÄúResponding to Change over Following a Plan.‚Äù And then came the
            frameworks. If you ask Google, there are more than 50 known Agile
            Frameworks (SCRUM, KanBan, etc.), not to mention the new scaling
            frameworks (SAFe, Scrum@Scale etc). We think it's high time to get
            back to first principles ‚Äì and that is what we advocate for here in
            our anti-framework for Getting $#*! Done at Scale.
          </p>

          <h3 class="font-semibold text-2xl">
            It‚Äôs About the Projects and People
          </h3>
          <p>
            If we put the frameworks, goal methodologies, and task management
            tools aside ‚Äì what are we left with? At the core, we do projects.
            And they‚Äôre done by a team of people. We have found that stripping
            away the jargon and process, and focusing on getting really good at
            the fundamentals, goes a long way toward improving productivity. In
            this case, that means helping people get really good at executing
            projects. In fact, that‚Äôs why we named our first product KATA.
            Japanese for ‚Äúform,‚Äù KATA is commonly used in martial arts to refer
            to practicing fundamentals to achieve overall mastery. üëå

                <p>
                  Moving fast means not wasting effort, which allows for more
                  shots on goal. Moving fast at scale means ensuring large
                  groups of people are spending their effort on the highest
                  value items ‚Äì to do work that matters ‚Äì in concert with one
                  another, in complex systems. You don‚Äôt just need raw speed.
                  You need velocity: speed AND direction. Otherwise you run the
                  risk of going really quickly in the wrong direction(s) and
                  ending up in the wrong place. This is where projects come in.

                  We‚Äôre Playing Poker, Not Chess
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Chess is a beautiful game of decision making and strategy, but
                  it‚Äôs also one of clear rules and complete information. You can
                  see the entire board all of the time. If you are a skilled
                  player, there is little betting in chess. Victory and skill
                  are closely correlated.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As nice as that might sound, real life is never that
                  straightforward. As Annie Duke states in her popular
                  book,Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't
                  Have All the Facts
                </p>
                <p>
                  Environments shift, information is incomplete, and there is no
                  perfect way to play. Every decision becomes a bet. And
                  projects are the bets organizations make. How we decide to
                  apply our finite resources and people.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When reframed as bets, you suddenly realize that projects
                  can‚Äôt be approached as a fixed set of things to do, aka tasks,
                  to achieve a known outcome. This is especially true in the
                  case of software development. Instead, projects should be
                  viewed as establishing a bet on a desired outcome, with
                  recognition that you are in an ever-changing environment with
                  incomplete information. Acknowledging this upfront lets the
                  team see shortcuts and optimizations they‚Äôd otherwise miss in
                  blind pursuit of task completion.

                  Focus on Outcomes, Not Outputs & Dates
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The popularity of task management tools makes it easy to
                  mistake speed for velocity. Look at all these tickets we are
                  closing! But are we moving the needle on our business
                  objectives? Are we having an impact for our customers?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Focusing a project on achieving an outcome, rather than
                  getting a bunch of tasks done, eliminates wasted effort. It
                  gives your team the guidance, and the autonomy, they need to
                  decide if a task is actually worth doing.
                </p>

                <p>
                  When you focus on achieving an outcome, rather than meeting a
                  (often poorly estimated) ship date, and pair it with thinking
                  in bets, you are in a better position to assess tradeoffs and
                  potential return on effort, or ROE. You can then match your
                  appetite for investment with the potential outcomes, and place
                  your bets (aka projects) accordingly.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This is powerful. Not only will you save wasted effort and
                  find shortcuts along your way, but it lets you say ‚Äúno‚Äù to
                  more projects upfront, avoiding even more wasted effort!

              <h3 class="font-semibold text-2xl leading-10">ROE Not ROI</h3>
              <p>
                It's a subtle but important mental shift. ROI is a financial
                term. But more often than not, we aren‚Äôt making financial
                investments with projects. Instead, we‚Äôre allocating people‚Äôs
                time and energy, which means we‚Äôre investing effort. So, Return
                on Effort. Why does this distinction matter? Well, the math is
                different. Sure, time is money and all that. But people are not
                resources. When you invest $100 and want to double your
                investment you invest $100 more. Asking people to work twice as
                hard yields variable results. You may get more or less than
                twice the effort depending on how you ask! And doubling the
                people, well, projects don't work like that . If you remember
                that we are making investment decisions not with algebra, but
                multivariable calculus, it will go a long way into better
                upfront decision making and appetite assessment.

                But Still Dates (Milestones)
              </h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                  Parkinson‚Äôs Law tells us projects expand to fill the time
                  they‚Äôre given. So projects MUST have a target ship date,
                  right? Otherwise they go on forever?
                </p>
                <p>
                  But we all recognize that projects evolve as they go. As we
                  make progress, we gain new information, which alters our
                  course. We rarely know the entire path forward when we start.
                  But, we do know the concrete next step, or milestone, we are
                  working towards. These milestones pull us closer to achieving
                  our overall objectives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tracking milestones keeps Parkinson‚Äôs Law at bay by tracking
                  smaller, higher confidence, interim goals. This lets you
                  subdivide the entropy for lower overall project risk, and have
                  small victories that build confidence and momentum.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>
                  The best way to write and set milestones is in the language of
                  your project‚Äôs end users and what is being achieved or
                  delivered. Not in task management terms ‚ÄúTax Engine V2‚Äù but in
                  project ones ‚ÄúBegin checkout completion rate test with new tax
                  engine‚Äù. For product development, use product functionality
                  language. For technical projects, use technical deliverables.
                  This makes it simple for everyone to connect the goals of the
                  project to the progress being made. For example, stating when
                  a new feature will be complete or a target country launched,
                  is more helpful than knowing that the ‚Äúback-end is complete.‚Äù
                </p>
                <p>
                  Status updates should then cover progress towards achieving
                  both these milestones, as well as the overall project outcome.
